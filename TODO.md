# TODO

- [x]  Finish implementing code generation
- [x]  Fix return values not being included in the function body
- [x]  Convert function identifier to FuncId without extra state tracking
- [x]  Fix adding more than two arguments to main causing strange results
- [x]  Improve context/ir/disassembly API
- [x]  Support parsing a function with no return values
- [x]  Do not require an underscore assignment when calling a function with no return values
- [ ]  Create a `Block` type that is just `Vec<Statement>`, but has a consistent syntax of `: statment statment;`
- [ ]  Use the `Block` type for functions
- [ ]  Pattern matching for ints
- [ ]  Add range operator
- [ ]  Support tuples
- [ ]  Bool condition loop (while loop)
- [ ]  Range loop (for loop)
- [ ]  Support optionally getting the index and/or value when iterating over a range
- [ ]  Improve error messaging to include line numbers (codespan-reporting crate? save for semantic analysis layer?)
- [ ]  Add unit tests for grammar parsing
- [ ]  Ensure that function definition order does not matter (declare a function when calling)
- [ ]  Validate number of parameters = number of arguments, ensure this is not reported as a compiler bug
- [ ]  Take a second pass over doc comments, and add more where necessary
- [ ]  Support lambdas/nested functions (might need to add func keyword for this?)
- [ ]  Add scenario tests for testing each feature of the language
- [ ]  Decide how variable shadowing should be handled
- [ ]  Update crate name and all instances of TODO_LANG_NAME with the name of the language.
- [ ]  Implement imports to allow splitting up code across multiple source files
