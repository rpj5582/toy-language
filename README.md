# TODO_LANG_NAME

A toy language that I am designing for fun. Compiler written in Rust using [peg](https://github.com/kevinmehall/rust-peg) for parsing and [Cranelift](https://cranelift.dev/) for machine code generation.

No plans for what the language will be called, what it's niche will be, or if I'll see it through, but just a fun side project for me right now.
